            contributed to a more sedentary lifestyle for many people. Here are some reasons why physical activity is

                <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
                <p>Sedentary Lifestyle Epidemic: With the rise of technology, many people spend a significant amount of
                    time sitting in front of screens, whether for work, entertainment, or communication. This sedentary
                    lifestyle has been linked to various health issues, making regular physical activity essential to
                    counteract its negative effects.
                    <br><br>Health Benefits: Engaging in regular physical activity is associated with numerous health
                    benefits. It can help prevent or manage chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease,
                    and hypertension. Physical activity also strengthens bones, muscles, and joints, improves
                    cardiovascular health, and enhances immune function.
                    <br><br>Mental Well-being: Physical activity is known to have positive effects on mental health. It
                    can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, alleviate stress, boost mood, and improve overall
                    psychological well-being. Physical activity releases endorphins, which are often referred to as
                    "feel-good" hormones.
                    <br><br>Longevity: Research consistently shows that individuals who engage in regular physical
                    activity tend to live longer and experience a higher quality of life in their later years.
                    <br><br>Stress Reduction: Modern life often comes with high levels of stress. Physical activity acts
                    as a natural stress reliever by reducing cortisol levels and promoting relaxation.
                    <br><br>Healthy Aging: As the global population ages, maintaining physical function and mobility
                    becomes increasingly important. Regular exercise can help older adults maintain their independence
                    and reduce the risk of falls and age-related health issues.
