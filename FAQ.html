                    This comes down to your goals, lifestyle and current fitness level. For those who are new or
                    returning to exercise, aiming for two to three workouts each week is a great place to start to build
                    your fitness while giving your body time to recover. Once that’s feeling easier, you can add more
                    workouts to your weekly schedule! When your fitness increases, you might be doing between four and
                    six workouts each week.<br><br>

                    In addition to your workouts, adding in gentle movement like walking, cycling or yoga can help to
                    build your fitness and stay active throughout the week.

                <h3>Should I do strength training, cardio or both?</h3>
                <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">
                    <path d="M3 3L21 21L39 3" stroke="white" stroke-width="7" stroke-linecap="round" />

                <p>
                    We recommend a mixture of cardio and strength training. Alternating between the two is a good way to
                    find balance. Why both and not just one? Because you want to reap the benefits of each!<br><br>

                    According to the American Cancer Society, two to three strength-based workouts each week can result
                    in significant health benefits, such as increased muscle mass, stronger bones, boosted metabolism,
                    better posture, balance and joint flexibility. Research shows it also can boost heart health and
                    have a positive impact on your mental health.<br><br>

                    Regularly increasing your heart rate and blood flow by adding cardio into your routine can also
                    promote heart, brain, skin and lung health, as well as improve your sleep and energy levels.

                <h3>How can I measure my progress?</h3>
                <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">
                    <path d="M3 3L21 21L39 3" stroke="white" stroke-width="7" stroke-linecap="round" />

                    When you start a fitness routine, you want to see results. Whether you’re looking to feel more
                    confident, improve your strength, or simply feel healthier, it can help to know if you’re making
                    progress.<br><br>

                    Think about what your unique goals are and how those would be best measured. If you’re wanting to
                    build strength with progressive overload, you could use the Sweat app to keep track of the weights
                    you’re lifting. If you’re wanting to feel more confident and healthy, you could use a journal to
                    record how you’re feeling. If you’re wanting to build endurance, you could complete regular fitness
                    challenges and track your progress.
