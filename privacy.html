                We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store

                cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice : https://www.metamorphosis.co.nz/cookie-policy .<br><br>


                5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?<br><br>


                In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have
                access to certain information about you.<br><br>


                Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account
                details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain
                profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may
                vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address,
                friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
                social media platform.<br><br>


                We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice
                or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control,
                and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media
                provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and
                share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and
                apps.<br><br>


                6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?<br><br>


                In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this
                privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.<br><br>


                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
                this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
                personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us .<br><br>


                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
                and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br><br>


                7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?<br><br>


                In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical
                security measures.<br><br>


                We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed
                to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
                efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
                technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
                improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
                your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
                risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.<br><br>


                8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?<br><br>

                We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the
                Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
                and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
                users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
                measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
                collected from children under age 18, please contact us at metamorphosismetropolis@gmail.com .<br><br>


                9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br><br>


                In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.<br><br>


                Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which
                may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw
                your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
                contact details provided in the section ' HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? ' below .<br><br>


                However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
                nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br><br>


                Account Information<br><br>


                If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
                account, you can:<br>
                Log in to your account settings and update your user account.<br>
                Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information
                from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with
                applicable legal requirements.<br><br>


                Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,
                you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to
                remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. For
                further information, please see our Cookie Notice: https://www.metamorphosis.co.nz/cookie-policy
                .<br><br>

                .<br><br>


                10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br><br>


                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (
                'DNT' ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard
                for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised . As such, we do not currently respond
                to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
                tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
                inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.<br><br>


                11. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br><br>
